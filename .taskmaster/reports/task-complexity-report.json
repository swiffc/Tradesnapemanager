			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 24 'Implement AI-Powered Test Generation Command' into 6 subtasks, focusing on: 1) Command structure implementation, 2) AI prompt engineering for test generation, 3) Test file generation and output, 4) Framework-specific template implementation, 5) MCP tool integration, and 6) Documentation and help system integration. Include detailed implementation steps, dependencies, and testing approaches for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to several challenging aspects: 1) AI integration requiring sophisticated prompt engineering, 2) Test generation across multiple frameworks, 3) File system operations with proper error handling, 4) MCP tool integration, 5) Complex configuration requirements, and 6) Framework-specific template generation. The task already has 5 subtasks but could benefit from reorganization based on the updated implementation details in the info blocks, particularly around framework support and configuration."
