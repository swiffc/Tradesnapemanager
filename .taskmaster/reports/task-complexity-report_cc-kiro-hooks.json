		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Task Integration Layer (TIL) Core",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the TIL Core implementation into distinct components: hook registration system, task lifecycle management, event coordination, state persistence layer, and configuration validation. Each subtask should focus on a specific architectural component with clear interfaces and testable boundaries.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational component with multiple complex subsystems including event-driven architecture, API integration, state management, and configuration validation. The existing 5 subtasks are well-structured and appropriately sized."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Dependency Monitor with Taskmaster MCP Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the dependency monitor into: dependency graph data structure implementation, circular dependency detection algorithm, Taskmaster MCP integration layer, and real-time notification system. Focus on performance optimization for large graphs and efficient caching strategies.",
			"reasoning": "Complex graph algorithms and real-time monitoring require careful implementation. The task involves sophisticated data structures, algorithm design, and API integration with performance constraints."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Execution Manager with Priority Queue and Parallel Execution",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the execution manager into: priority queue implementation, resource conflict detection system, parallel execution coordinator, timeout and cancellation handler, and execution history persistence layer. Each component should handle specific aspects of concurrent task management.",
			"reasoning": "Managing concurrent execution with resource conflicts, priority scheduling, and persistence is highly complex. Requires careful synchronization, error handling, and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Safety Manager with Configurable Constraints and Emergency Controls",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: constraint validation engine, emergency control system (stop/pause), user approval workflow implementation, and safety monitoring/audit logging. Each subtask should address specific safety aspects with fail-safe mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Safety systems require careful design with multiple fail-safes. The task involves validation logic, real-time controls, workflow management, and comprehensive logging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Event-Based Hook Processor",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: file system event integration, Git/VCS event listeners, build system event connectors, and event filtering/debouncing mechanism. Focus on modular event source integration with configurable processing pipelines.",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, integrating multiple event sources with proper filtering and performance optimization requires careful implementation. Each event source has unique characteristics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Prompt-Based Hook Processor with AI Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: prompt interception mechanism, NLP-based task suggestion engine, context injection system, and conversation-based status updater. Each component should handle specific aspects of AI conversation integration.",
			"reasoning": "AI integration with prompt analysis and dynamic context injection is complex. Requires understanding of conversation flow, relevance scoring, and seamless integration with existing systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Update-Based Hook Processor for Automatic Progress Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: code change monitor, acceptance criteria validator, dependency update propagator, and conflict detection/resolution system. Focus on accurate progress tracking and automated validation logic.",
			"reasoning": "Automatic progress tracking requires integration with version control and intelligent analysis of code changes. Conflict detection and dependency propagation add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Real-Time Automation Dashboard and User Controls",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: WebSocket real-time communication layer, interactive dependency graph visualization, task queue and status displays, user control interfaces, and analytics/charting components. Each UI component should be modular and reusable.",
			"reasoning": "Building a responsive real-time dashboard with complex visualizations and interactive controls is challenging. Requires careful state management, performance optimization, and user experience design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Kiro IDE and Taskmaster MCP with Core Services",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: KiroHookAdapter implementation, TaskmasterMCPAdapter development, error handling and retry logic layer, and IDE UI component integration. Focus on robust adapter patterns and comprehensive error recovery.",
			"reasoning": "End-to-end integration of multiple systems with different architectures is highly complex. Requires careful adapter design, extensive error handling, and thorough testing across all integration points."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Management and Safety Profiles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: visual configuration editor UI, JSON Schema validation engine, import/export functionality, and version control integration. Each component should provide intuitive configuration management with robust validation.",
			"reasoning": "While technically less complex than core systems, building an intuitive configuration editor with validation, versioning, and import/export requires careful UI/UX design and robust data handling."
